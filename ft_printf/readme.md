# ft_printf

## Description
`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the standard C library function `printf`.
The project aims to strengthen understanding of variadic functions, formatted output, and low-level string manipulation in C.

This implementation supports the following format specifiers:
- `%c` – character
- `%s` – string
- `%p` – pointer
- `%d` / `%i` – signed integer
- `%u` – unsigned integer
- `%x` / `%X` – hexadecimal (lowercase/uppercase)
- `%%` – literal percent sign

The function is designed to mimic the behavior of the standard `printf`, including the return value, which corresponds to the number of characters printed.

## Instructions

### Compilation
Compile the library using the following commands:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -c *.c
ar rcs libftprintf.a *.o
```
Usage

Include the header and link the library in your project:
```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main(void)
{
    int len;

    len = ft_printf("Hello %s! Number: %d\n", "world", 42);
    ft_printf("Printed %d characters\n", len);
    return 0;
}
```
Requirements

Adherence to the 42 coding standard.
Proper memory management with no leaks.
Output must match the standard printf behavior.

Features

Supports all mandatory 42 project format specifiers.
Returns the correct number of printed characters.
Handles NULL strings gracefully.
Standalone implementation with no external dependencies.

Technical Details

Utilizes va_list to handle variable arguments.
Custom functions for string and number conversions.
Minimal and efficient memory usage.

Example
```c
ft_printf("Character: %c, String: %s, Pointer: %p\n", 'A', "Hello", &len);
ft_printf("Hexadecimal: %x, Unsigned: %u, Percent: %%\n", 255, 42);
```
